 How do you interact as developers?\newline
 
\newline
\textbf{Team organization}\newline
  How is the team organized?\newline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A complete description of stages and tools included in the CI/CD chains.(That is, including deployment and release of your systems.)
  \item Organization of your repositor(ies).(That is, either the structure of of mono-repository or organization of artifacts across repositories. --> In essence, it has to be be clear what is stored where and why.)
  \item Applied branching strategy.
  \item Applied development process and tools supporting it (For example, how did you use issues, Kanban boards, etc. to organize open tasks)
  \item How do you monitor your systems and what precisely do you monitor?
  \item What do you log in your systems and how do you aggregate logs?
  \item Brief results of the security assessment.
  \item Applied strategy for scaling and load balancing.
  \item In essence it has to be clear how code or other artifacts come from idea into the running system and everything that happens on the way.
