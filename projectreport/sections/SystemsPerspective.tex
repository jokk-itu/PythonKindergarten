\section{System's Perspective}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design of your ITU-MiniTwit systems.
  \item Architecture of your ITU-MiniTwit systems.
  \item All dependencies of your ITU-MiniTwit systems on all levels of abstraction and development stages. (That is, list and briefly describe all technologies and tools you applied and depend on.)
  \item Important interactions of subsystems.
  \item Describe the current state of your systems, for example using results of static analysis and quality assessment systems.
  \item Finally, describe briefly, if the license that you have chosen for your project is actually compatible with the licenses of all your direct dependencies.
