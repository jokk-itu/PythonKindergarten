\section{Introduction}
This project report is written in connection with the 2021 'DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Evolution' 
spring elective course at the IT-University of Copenhagen. 
\newline The main purpose of this project was to refactor a small social-media project, orignally 
named 'ITU-MiniTwit' written in Python into the programming language of choice (which became C\#). 

Thereafter, various DevOps tools, such as virtualization, automated deployment, logging/monitoring, and security analysis,  
which all allow for continuous integration/continuous deployment, were applied to our 'PythonKindergarten' application. 
This report reflects and discusses the DevOps process that we as a group undertook.
