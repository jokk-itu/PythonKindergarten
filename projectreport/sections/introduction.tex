\section{Introduction}
This project report is written in connection with the 'DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Evolution' spring elective course in 2021 at the IT-University of Copenhagen. The main purpose of this project was to refactor a small social-media project, orignally named 'ITU-MiniTwit' written in Python into the programming language of choice (which became C\#). Thereafter, various DevOps tools, such as containerization, virtualization, logging, and security analysis,  which all allow for continuos integration/continuous deployment, were applied to our 'PythonKindergarten MiniTwit' application. This report reflects and discusses the DevOps process that we as a group undertook.
