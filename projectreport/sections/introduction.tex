\section{Introduction}
This project report is written in connection with the 'DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Evolution' spring elective course in 2021 at the IT-University of Copenhagen. The main purpose of this project was to refactor a small social-media project named 'MiniTwit' written in Python into the programming language of choice (which became C\#). Thereafter, various DevOps tools such as contanerization, monitoring, logging, scalabilty, and security analysis  that allow for continuos integration/continuous deployment were applied to our application.
